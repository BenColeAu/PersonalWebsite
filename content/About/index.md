I work in IT across service delivery, endpoint management, and technical support. My experience in the Australian local government sector spans day-to-day support, Intune and Configuration Manager administration, PowerShell automation, and occasional server management. I focus on ensuring IT systems are reliable, efficient, and well-maintained, streamlining processes and improving operational consistency.

In addition to Windows, I manage iOS and Android devices through Intune, maintaining consistent configuration and security across mixed device environments. This site provides scripts, notes, and practical insights drawn from my real-world experience that may be useful to others in this area.

As well as managing all iOS, Android & Windows endpoints I manage the Audio Visual devices via Teams drawing on my experience in broadcast from experience in Broadcast so the occasional article may appear from that also.
